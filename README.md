# Overview
Mitosis is an experiment _runner_.
It handles administrative tasks to decrease the mental overhead of collaboration:
* Creating a CLI for your experiment
* Recording commit information
* Tracking parameterization, as well as parameter names (e.g. "low-noise")
* Storing logs
* Generating HTML visuals
* Pickling result data

The virtuous consequence of these checks and organization
    is a faster workflow,
    a more rigorous scientific method,
    and reduced mental overhead of collaboration.

## Trivial Example

Hypothesis: the maximum value of a sine wave is equal to its amplitude.

*sine_experiment/\_\_init\_\_.py*


    import numpy as np
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

    name = "sine-exp"
    lookup_dict = {"frequency": {"fast": 10, "slow": 1}}

    def run(amplitude, frequency):
        """Deterimne if the maximum value of the sine function equals ``amplitude``"""
        x = np.arange(0, 10, .05)
        y = amplitude * np.sin(frequency * x)
        err = np.abs(max(y) - amplitude)
        plt.title("What's the maximum value of a sine wave?")
        plt.plot(x, y, label="trial data")
        plt.plot(x, amplitude * np.ones_like(x), label="expected")
        plt.legend()
        return {"main": err, "data": y}


*pyproject.toml*

    [tool.mitosis.steps]
    my_exp = ["sine_experiment:run", "sine_experiment:lookup_dict"]


Commit these changes to a repository.  After installing sine_experiment as a python package, in CLI, run:

    mitosis my_exp --param my_exp.frequency=slow --eval-param my_exp.amplitude=4

Mitosis will run `sin_experiment.run()`, saving
all output as an html file in a subdirectory.  It will also
track the parameters and results.
If you later change the variant named "slow" to set frequency=2, mitosis will
raise a `RuntimeError`, preventing you from running a trial.  If you want to run
`sine_experiment` with a different parameter value, you need to name that variant
something new.  Eval parameters, like "amplitude" in the example, behave differently.
Rather than being specified by `lookup_dict`, they are evaluated directly.


# Use

Philosophically, an experiment is any time we run code with an aim to convince someone
    of something.
As code, mitosis takes the approach that an experiment is a callable
    (or a sequence of callables).

Using mitosis involves
    registering experiments in pyproject.toml,
    naming interesting parameters,
    running experiments on the command line,
    and browsing results.

## Registration

mitosis uses the `tool.mitosis.steps` table of pyproject.toml to learn
    what python callables are experiment steps
        and where to lookup named parameter values.
It uses a syntax evocative of entry points:

    [tool.mitosis.steps]
    my_exp = ["sine_experiment:run", "sine_experiment:lookup_dict"]

Experiment steps must be callables with a dictionary return type.  The returned
dictionary is required to have a key "main".  All but the final step in an experiment
must also have a key "data" that gets passed to the first argument of the subsequent
step.  If the key "metrics" is present, it will display prominently in the HTML output

_Developer note: Building an experiment step static type at_ `mitosis._typing.ExpRun`

## CLI

The basic invocation lists the steps along with the values of any parameters for each
step.

    mitosis [OPTION...] step [steps...] [[-p step.lookup_param=key...]
        [-e step.eval_param=val...]]...

Some nuance:
* `--debug` can be used to waive a lot of the reproducibility checks mitosis does.
    This arg allows you to run experiments in a dirty git repository (or no repository)
    and will neither save results in the experimental database, nor increment the trials
    counter, nor verify/lock in the definitions of any variants.  It will, however,
    create the output notebook.  It also changes the experiment log level  from INFO
    to DEBUG.
* lookup parameters can be nearly any python object that is pickleable.  Tracking
    parameter values can be turned off for parameters either for something that isn't
    pickleable (e.g. a lambda function) or isn't important to track
    (e.g. which GPU to run on).  This can be done with eval or lookup parameters
    by adding a `+` to the parameter, e.g. `-e +jax_playground.gpu_id=1`.
* Eval parameters which are strings will need quotation marks that escape the shell
    (e.g. `-e smoothing.kernel=\"rbf\"`)
* `-e` and `-p` are short form for `--eval-param` and `--param` (lookup param).

## Results

Trials are saved in `trials/` (or whatever is passed after `-F`).  Each trial has a
pseudorandom bytes key, postpended to a metadata folder and an html output filename.

There are two obviously useful things to do after an experiment:
* view the html file.  `python -m http.server` is helpful to browse results
* load the data with `mitosis.load_trial_data()`

Beyond this, the metadata mitosis keeps to disk is useful for troubleshooting or reproducing experiments, but no facility yet exists to browse or compare experiments.

## API

Mitosis is primarily intended as a command line program, so `mitosis --help` has the syntax documentation.
There is only one intentionally public part of the api: `mitosis.load_trial_data()`.
